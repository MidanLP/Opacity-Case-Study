# Opacity Case Study

This project supports the case study and practical evaluation for the thesis **"Analyzing System Confidentiality: A Case Study of a Real-World System using Timed Automata"** submitted at TU Berlin. It includes simulation scripts, verification data, and a web system used to illustrate and benchmark opacity in discrete-timed systems.

## Project Structure

- `Testing/` ‚Äì Contains files and scipts for testing of the Website
- `Theory/` ‚Äì Includes theoretical explanations and resources related to opacity.
- `Website/` ‚Äì Holds the complete website files showcasing the case study and scipts to easily host and test the websites

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup (Healthcare Site with Apache)

For a more detailed tutorial, see:

- [Apache Virtual Hosts Documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/)
- [DigitalOcean Apache Guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-apache-web-server-on-ubuntu-20-04)

but make sure to add our scripts, files and folders and update all paths and links accordingly

For a quick setup that uses python instead of Apache see Backup

To set up the case study:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MidanLP/Opacity-Case-Study.git
```

### 2. Copy Healthcare files into Apache directory

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/Healthcare
sudo cp -r Opacity-Case-Study/Website/Healthcare/* /var/www/Healthcare/
```

### 3. Set Permissions

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/Healthcare
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/Healthcare
```

### 4. Configure Apache to Listen on Port 8080

Edit:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```

Ensure this line exists:

```apache
Listen 8080
```

### 5. Create the Virtual Host Config

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/healthcare.conf
```

Paste:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:8080>
    ServerName healthcare.local
    DocumentRoot /var/www/Healthcare

    <Directory /var/www/Healthcare>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/healthcare_error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/healthcare_access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

### 6. Enable the Site and Restart Apache

```bash
sudo a2ensite healthcare.conf
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Backup 
```
python .\Website\runWebsites.py    
```

## üìÇ Dependencies

Make sure the following are installed:

- Python 3+
- `pandas`
- `selenium`
- `matplotlib`
- `webdriver-manager` (ChromeDriverManager)

---

## üß∞ Testing

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
2. Navigate to the `Testing` folder.
3. Open `Test_Website.py` and adjust:
   - Paths to correct locations
   - Link to Healthcare image (e.g. `http://localhost:8081/parachute.jpeg`)
4. Run the script:

```bash
python Test_Website.py
```

5. Input number of test runs (default: 1)
6. Input `yes/no` to clear cache between runs
7. View results in `time_output.xlsx`, sheet: `Testing Times`
